GridStatusRaidDebuff:Debuff(en_zone, first, second, icon_priority, color_priority, timer, stackable, color, default_disable, noicon)
zone - name of zone
First - SpellId
Second - Order (the order they show up when listed)
icon_priority - Icon Priority (larger is higher priority)
color_priority - Color Priority (larger is higher priority)
timer - Show remaining timer
stackable - show debuff stacks
color - color if no icon
default_disable - If true, don't show debuff by default
noicon - show color but no icon

Note: Debuffs are detected by name by Grid, not by spellid. So there is no need to add multiple debuffs of the same name if there are different spell ids by difficulty and such.
